# Sms_Spam_Classification

SMS Spam Classification is a project focused on automatically detecting and classifying spam messages in SMS texts using machine learning techniques. With the increasing prevalence of spam messages, it's essential to develop tools that can accurately identify and filter out such unwanted content.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to build a robust SMS spam classification system that can analyze text data and accurately predict whether a message is spam or not. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we can effectively differentiate between legitimate and spam messages, ensuring a better user experience and improved message filtering.

## Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: The text data goes through preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, removing punctuation and special characters, and tokenization to prepare it for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: The project includes various feature engineering techniques, such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings, to represent the text data numerically for machine learning algorithms.
- Classification Models: Several classification models, including decision trees, random forests, naive bayes classifier, or deep learning models, are employed to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques are also applied for robust model selection.
- Deployment: The trained model can be deployed as an API or integrated into existing applications for real-time SMS spam classification.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/oldmonk018/Sms_Spam_Classification.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install nltk`, pip install re.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks: The `notebooks` directory contains step-by-step guides on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. Try out the example code: The `examples` directory provides sample code to use the trained model for SMS spam classification on new messages.
5. Customize and adapt: Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different models, or incorporate your own datasets to improve performance and adapt it to your specific needs.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a labeled dataset of SMS messages containing instances of spam and non-spam messages. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset used in this project is not publicly available.
